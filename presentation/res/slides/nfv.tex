\begin{frame}{Network Function Virtualization}

  Exploit virtualization technology to provide function only as
  software entities called Virtual Network Function (\textbf{VNF})

  \vfill{}

  Allows to remove specific hardware and make it possible to run VNFs on
  \textbf{general purpose} machines

  \vfill{}

  NFV is not a silver bullet
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Does not preserve transport end-to-end semantic
    \item Some functions natural choice is on the end-to-end path
    \item Efficient (online) algorithms required
  \end{itemize}
