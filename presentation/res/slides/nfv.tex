\begin{frame}{Network Function Virtualization}

  Exploiting virtualization technology is possible to provide function only as
  software entities called Virtual Network Function (\textbf{VNF})

  \vfill{}

  It allows to remove specific hardware and make it possible to run VNFs on
  \textbf{general purpose} machines

  \vfill{}

  Efficient algorithms and resource management is required to provide same
  performances as hardware ones
