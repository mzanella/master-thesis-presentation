  Network functions deployed as middleboxes on the end-to-end path to improve
  the overall system performance

  \vfill{}

  These functions are currently provided as a combination of vendor specific
  hardware and software

  This approach has some drawbacks
  \begin{itemize}
    \item long product cycles
    \item higher costs
    \item more difficult updates
  \end{itemize}
