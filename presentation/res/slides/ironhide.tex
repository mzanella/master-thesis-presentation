    \texttt{Ironhide} is the component that manages traffic at
    \textbf{ingress/egress} point of the network

    \vfill{}

    Tasked with packet/flow classification
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Classification based on \textbf{transport layer protocol} used
      \item Performed only at the edges of the chain, not during the traversal
    \end{itemize}

    \vfill{}

    Packets entering/leaving the SFC domain are \textbf{(de)encapsulated}
    accordingly
